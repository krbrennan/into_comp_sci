// Samantha and Vikas are looking to buy a house in a new development.
// After looking at various models, the three models they like are colonial,
// split-entry, and single-story. The builder gave them the base price and
// the finished area in square feet of the three models. They want to know
// the model(s) with the least price per square foot. Write a program that
// accepts as input the base price and the finished area in square feet of
// the three models. The program outputs the model(s) with the least price
// per square foot.

// to_do:
// calculate which home-type offers best bang-for-$
// colonial, split-entry, single-story
// input: base price and finished area in sq.ft of the three models
// output: model(s) with the lest price per sq.ft.

// Ask for price and sq foot of each house-type
// Determine which type is cheapest per sq ft
